# js-1fwpat

[Edit on StackBlitz ⚡️](https://stackblitz.com/edit/js-1fwpat)

With this example you can set a multi theme site by using native css variables and JavaScript functions.

Basically you set variables and its default values at style.css file
Then we load themes.json as a configuration file where we can specify as much themes as we need, then we set those values with functions.js

You don't need to reload page to see changes applied.

It's my first repository in platform, I appreciate any help to make it clearer.
